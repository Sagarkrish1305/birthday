Happiest Birthday Beautiful ❤️..
May your special day be filled with love and laughter..
To my best friend: I love you. I don't say it enough but I do.  We've had each other's backs for years  You know things about me no one else does, and know me better than I probably do. I trust you the way I trust no one else and no time or distance could ruin the bond we have but it changed i know and for that I am sorry...
I love the way we go right back to how we are  So many jokes, tears, memories and laughter, fights and dreams, we've come a long way and have much farther to go. I'm Just glad I'll have you with me the whole way.
Once again Many many happy returns of the day and many happy to come ❤️✨
