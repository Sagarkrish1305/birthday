Hello Priya, 
                  I know you are reading this. You know what I think? I think that I am the easiest Clue of all of the others. I believe that you guessed me immediately. (Arrogance hai mera. Even if itâ€™s wrong toh mujhe kahaan pata chalne wala haiðŸ˜‚)

Anyways, a very Happy Birthday to you. You know aapde jyaare 10th ma ek bijaane joya toh taru su reaction aayu? I was toh like aa kyaanthi aayiðŸ˜‚ I was so scared to talk to you. But, at that time you initiated the talk. That is when our friendship starts. You know you are the first good friend Iâ€™ve ever had. I never had good friends before 10th and after 10th you and anas were all to me.

Ek vaar toh mara ghare jhagdo thayi gayoto that you and anas are the only good people to me and No One else. (Papa ee almost lapho mari didho hottðŸ¥²)

All this time, you held me very tightly. We had so many fights. I was so possessive sometimes. we made mistakes. Some things were wrong some things were right. But, you held me. 

And THANK YOU FOR BEING THAT PART OF MY LIFE. Iâ€™m grateful to have you. Because, there are ONE GOOGLE ( 10^100 ) reasons to leave. But, there is only one to stay and that is to hold or to be held. 

I know somethings are changed between us.  But now, I want to be there for you whenever you need me. Just ek call kari deje. Even if I am angry or sad or busy. I will talk to you.

Teri life ka chhota tukda hi kyun na reh jaau. par, chahta hu ke mere naam sunn ke tu hamesha khush rahe. (I will try my best)

Ik thoda senti ho rha hu. But, it shows that I care. I hope that you will have a great future ahead and a great husband too (Ik you donâ€™t want to marry anyone but, I feel that you will find someone someday)

from Krish.
