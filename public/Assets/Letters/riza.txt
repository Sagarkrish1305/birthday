Dear Priya, 

Happy Birthday, bro! Well, you already have me as your friend, so what else do you even have to wish for? I mean, I'm such a rare and amazing friend, you know... 

Lol, kidding! But on a serious note, I hope you are doing well. Recently, we haven't been talking much because we're both busy with our own lives, and I'm really sorry that I keep delaying our plans to meet up. But trust me, I really want to meet you; I'm just waiting for the time when both of our schedules are free. Since I'm writing this, I've realized that I haven't opened up to you like this before, but I guess I will do it now. You are one of the few people with whom I can be myself without feeling anxious or nervous. I can talk to you freely, knowing that I won't be judged. I am actually grateful for having you as my friend. I know you must be feeling weird reading this from me, since I've never said something like this before, as I suck at showing affection but I genuinely feel this way.

Thank you so much for being my friend. Let's meet soon, and I want a party when we do, haha!

Once Again wishing you a birthday as sweet as you
