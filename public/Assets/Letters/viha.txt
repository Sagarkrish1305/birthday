Dear prii,
Happiest birthday to you, I wish that this year you smile a little more and worry a little less
I love it when you are all happy and silly but i also love the parts of you that are broken somehow,
You are growing at your own pace and i am very proud of you. You are the person who i can truly vibe with
and be myself , you are the person i want to share all of my teaðŸ˜‚.
May you have strength to cut down ties with the ones who hurted you ,move on and live happily.
And alsooo from now on please do take my advice seriously coz it could prevent soo much trouble.
Ok ok chaloo love u , byeeee.
