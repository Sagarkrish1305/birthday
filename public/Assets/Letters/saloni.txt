To my dear priyeeee,
I love you priye for who you are, the most prettiest one of all , the most beautiful soul like who can make people around her go crazy( jo sense me Lena ho le sakte ho guys) the cutest , the sweetest, meri girlfriend hai yaar tu ( and I mean it in literal terms okayy, I am super possessive for you).
Thank you priye for being a part of my life for 6 years now . I really feel blessed for having you besides me in every major and minor decisions of my life from making me study to deciding what I should do further , from pampering me to giving me reality checks , from you listening to my crap and then making me understand about life.
I still remember the tuition days , the best one where we were being scold and the only excuse I had was  "it was a handkerchief sir" but our friendship grew more stronger through the lockdown days and our endless yapping on calls, and I wish it grows more stronger and stronger through coming years and budhapa ma aapda pase aur sari gossips hoy hasva mate. May we face more lesbian allegations together.
All my love , power to you priye you are the best!!!
Though I may not have been there like you have always been there for me but I have seen you face all that harsh times and I am super proud for you that how strong you are priyee..
Thank you for always being Taylor to my selena , for being Monica to my Rachel.
I LOVE YOU THE MOST PRIYE.
